# Legends Of Runterra  

## About The Project  
"Legends Of Runeterra Card Gallery" was one of my favourite projects because that's when I used the Express framework for the first time  
and that's when I understood how a good frontend should look.  
The application is a card gallery where the user can search and group cards using different filters. The user can make a customized deck according to their choices.
