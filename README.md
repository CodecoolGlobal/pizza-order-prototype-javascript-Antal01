## About The Project  
"Legends Of Runeterra Card Gallery" was one of my favourite projects because that's when I used the Express framework for the first time and that's when I understood how a good frontend should look.  
The application is a card gallery where the user can search and group cards using different filters, for example:
* Region  
* Type  
* Rarity
   
The user can create a customized deck according to their preferences, which can be edited.  
Additionally, if the user desires, they can delete the deck and create a new one.
